## Triple Bonzi Chaos
Uh oh! Bonzi Buddy Clones are attacking and Bonzi Buddy needs YOUR help!

There are three Bonzi Bosses, which all need to be taken down before it's too late! Additional clones are able to drop Banana Blasters which can be used against the Bonzi Bosses.  

Be careful though, the Bonzi Bosses will try to smash your face, and will obliterate anything in its path!

Take a minute... and help a friend out! Or have some friends help you out! You can play Triple Bonzi Chaos with multiple players!

## REWARDS!!!
Did you take a minute and help Bonzi Buddy out? Great! Now you are eligible to some complementary hats, sponsored by Bonzi Buddy himself!

NOTE: *Bonzi Buddy is NOT responsible for any possible side effects of helping Bonzi Buddy out. By helping Bonzi Buddy, you agree to risk your Minecraft character's well-being and are obligated to do everything in your power to defend Bonzi Buddy in the virtual video game. Any and all lost items are not insured. Let's save Bonzi Buddy, together!*

Didn't defeat all the Bonzi Bosses? No worries(actually there's a lot to worry about)! You can still be rewarded for getting a boss' health really low. If you did defeat all 3 Bonzi Bosses, you get a special Bonzi Buddy Hat Of Legends!
